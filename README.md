Redash
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davezuko/redash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davezuko/redash)

Redash is a lightweight library meant to fill the gap between Ramda (functional) and Lodash (performance). All functions are auto-curried and expect data as the last argument to encourage composition. Redash's ultimate goal is to remain as lightweight as possible; that means zero dependencies and an incredibly focused API that will give you the right tools for the job and nothing more.
